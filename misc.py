        We are a group of students who live to talk about classes and nerdy stuff.
        If you need help, please ping any of our Execs, Execs at large, or First Year Reps.
        
        Our general channels include some of the following:
        #off-topic, where we discuss damn near anything.
        #first-years, for students who are starting, or about to start their first year.
        #discussion, for serious non-academic discussion. (Politics et al.)
        #sfu-discussions, for all SFU related discussion.
        #projects_and_dev, for non-academic tech/dev/project discussion.
        #bot_commands_and_misc, for command testing to reduce spam on other channels.
        
        
        We also have a smattering of course specific Academic channels.
        You can give yourself a class role by running <.iam cmpt320> or create a new class by <.newclass cmpt316>
        Please keep Academic Honesty in mind when discussing course material here.
